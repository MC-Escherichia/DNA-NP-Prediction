* Background
** Given Data
#+begin_src matlab :session *MATLAB*

#+end_src
** Radial Basis Function
** Parameters in question
**

* Optimization Approach
** Strategy
** mldivide vs. mrdivide
** What are |X_Tr|, |X_V|, |X_Te|?
*** Apoorv's graph
*** S and Q histogram
** Error's in testing vs. validation are correlated
** Results of one model





#+begin_src matlab :exports both :session *MATLAB*

#+end_src





** In ten models, how valid are the "clusters of the points"
** In ten models, is there a statistical difference between the entropy of clusters vs. labeled
** What does the landscape look like.
* Monte Carlo Approach
** Stan
** Bayesian Inference
** Which points are most informative


* Notes
** How sharp are super ellipsoid?
** BCC to FCC with harmonic
** Add custom potential
