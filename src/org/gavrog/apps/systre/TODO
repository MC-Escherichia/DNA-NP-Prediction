=====================================================

Open bugs/issues:

- Parser should issue warnings for missing or unrecognized statements.
- Issue warnings on illegal unit cell parameters.

=====================================================

Planned/requested features:

- Optionally add 'point symbols' (shortest rings per angle) to output.
- Keep order of vertices.
- Optionally merge vertices with identical neighbor sets.
- Option to stop on error.
- Produce a log file when using GUI version non-step mode.

- Option to keep original embedding.
- Support global node repulsion in embedder.

- Better phrasing when component has multiple translates.
- Command line version can write cgd files.
- Option to simplify graphs with 1- or 2-coordinated nodes.
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- Compute vertex symbols.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.
- Make choice of output formats more self-explanatory.

- Print parametric positions for nodes and edge centers.
- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Report induced symmetries from "given" (or report none at all) for components.
