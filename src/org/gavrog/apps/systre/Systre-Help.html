<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The program S<small>YSTRE</small> is designed to analyze periodic nets
as they arise in the study of extended crystal structures (as opposed
to molecular crystals). The acronym stands for <em>Symmetry, Structure
and Refinement</em>. S<small>YSTRE</small> uses a method called
<em>barycentric placement</em> to determine the ideal (i.e., maximal
embeddable) symmetry of a crystal net and to analyze its topological
structure. It then generates a unique "fingerprint" for the
topological type of the given net and uses that to look up the
structure in its built-in database (see below). Users can also create
their own databases.
</p>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> also computes a refined embedding of the given
net using a method based on simulated forces. The targeted embedding
is one that minimizes the edge length variance (normalized to unit
length) and maximizes the unit cell volume. The forces modeled are not
physically realistic, but should in most cases result in viable input
for molecular modeling software.
</p>

<p>
Currently, S<small>YSTRE</small>'s built-in database contains all
processable nets from the
<a href="http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/rcsr_nets">RCSR online resource</a>
  as well as all structures listed in the
<a href="http://izasc.ethz.ch/fmi/xsl/IZA-SC/ft.xsl">Database of
  Zeolite Framework Types</a> as of July 7, 2008.
</p>

<p>
RCSR nets that Systre currently cannot handle are
<tt>bad</tt>, <tt>bae</tt>, <tt>bai</tt>, <tt>bbu</tt>, <tt>bcr</tt>,
<tt>cys</tt>, <tt>fco</tt>, <tt>lcw</tt>, <tt>nbo-g</tt>, <tt>uld</tt>
and <tt>ulm</tt>.
</p>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> is part of <a href="http://www.gavrog.org">The
Gavrog Project</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> requires a Java runtime environment (JRE) of
version 1.4.2 or higher. Java is now a standard part of Mac OS X. On
other systems, Java might already be installed as a prerequisite for
other programs, such as a web browser. Otherwise, the most
straightforward way to get a JRE is to download it from
<tt>java.sun.com</tt> and follow the installation instructions given
there. Set all path variables correctly for your system as instructed
(this should be done automatically if you use a Windows installer), so
that the <tt>java</tt> command can be recognized. If supported by your
system, make sure that the file extension <tt>.jar</tt> is associated
with the Java executable.
</p>

<p>
Installing S<small>YSTRE</small> itself is very easy.  Just download
the file <tt>Systre.jar</tt> and put it anywhere you like, for example
on your desktop. A S<small>YSTRE</small> executable is also included
in the 3dt distribution available from
<a href="http://www.gavrog.org">http://www.gavrog.org</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>
The 3dt installer automatically installs S<small>YSTRE</small> as well
and creates a batch file <tt>Systre</tt> or <tt>Systre.bat</tt> in the
<tt>bin</tt> subdirectory of your
chosen installation location. Please refer to your operating system
documentation on how to execute such files. On Windows and some Unix
machines, the installer can also create desktop icons for both 3dt and
S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to start S<small>YSTRE</small> is to double-click on
its icon. If that does not work, and you are sure that Java is
correctly installed and all path variables set correctly, open a
console window and type the command
</p>

<pre>
    java -jar Systre.jar
</pre>

<p>
from the same folder that you put <tt>Systre.jar</tt>
in. Alternatively, add the appropriate path. For example, if you
downloaded <tt>Systre.jar</tt> to a folder named
<tt>C:\Programs\Systre</tt> (on a Windows system), change the above to
</p>

<pre>
    java -jar C:\Programs\Systre\Systre.jar
</pre>

<p>
To make things easier, you can create a batch file (a.k.a. shell
script) containing the command. Please refer to your operating system
manual on how to create and execute such files.
</p>

<p>
Using S<small>YSTRE</small> is very simple. Run S<small>YSTRE</small>,
then use the [<tt>Open...</tt>] button to read in a file of net
descriptions. S<small>YSTRE</small> will process the first net in the
file and describe the results in an informal way. If there are more
nets, use the [<tt>Next</tt>] button to step through them. When you
are finished with a file, you can store the results in one of several
formats using the [<tt>Save as...</tt>] button. The [<tt>Help</tt>]
button displays this text and, finally, the [<tt>Options...</tt>]
button lets you modify some of S<small>YSTRE</small>'s internal
workings.
</p>

<h2><a name="file_formats">File Formats</a></h2>

<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> uses three basic file types:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Input files (containing definitions of nets) with the extension
<tt>.cgd</tt></li>
<li>Archive files (containing fingerprints for nets) with the
extension <tt>.arc</tt></li>
<li>Protocol files (to save S<small>YSTRE</small>'s onscreen output)
with the extension <tt>.out</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you read or write a file from within S<small>YSTRE</small>, the
extension will determine the format of the file and the extend of
information in it. Typically, you would read an input file and save
the output in a protocol file. But you might also want to produce a
<tt>.cgd</tt> file with the new symmetry group and node positions
as determined by S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<p>
If you are dealing with a large number of nets that
S<small>YSTRE</small> does not know of, you might want to read and
write your own archive files. These contain fingerprints of nets
processed by S<small>YSTRE</small>. If you read in an archive file
after starting S<small>YSTRE</small>, it will temporarily add those
fingerprints to its list of "known" nets and thus recognize
them. There is of yet no sophisticated way of managing user
archives. If you write an output file with the extension
<tt>.arc</tt>, it will contain fingerprints of all the "new" nets so
far encountered in the current file. Each block of lines in which the
first line starts with the word <tt>key</tt> and the last line reads
<tt>end</tt> constitutes one fingerprint. You can use a standard text
editor to cut and paste those blocks and thus maintain your own
private archives of nets.
</p>

<dt><b>Space Group Symbol</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
Enter the space group symbol as it appears in the International Tables,
except that "bar 3", "bar 4" etc. are written as -3, -4 and so on and
subscripts are written as regular numbers. Examples: <tt>Fd-3m</tt>,
<tt>I41/amd</tt>, <tt>P212121</tt>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Origin choice</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
If you specify a crystal without explicit edges as in the first and
fourth example below, S<small>YSTRE</small> needs to compute edges
based on nearest neighbors. This does not only depend on the correct
cell parameters, but also on the origin choice. For groups that have
two conventional choices as according to the international tables,
S<small>YSTRE</small> uses the second one by default. This can be
changed in the 'Options' dialog.
</p>

<p>
Another way to make sure that the correct origin choice is used is to
append <tt>:1</tt> or <tt>:2</tt>, respectively, to the group name as
in Example 4 below.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Rhombohedral groups</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
Hexagonal versus rhombohedral settings for rhombohedral groups are
handled analogously to the above. In this case, append <tt>:H</tt>
(the default) or <tt>:R</tt>, accordingly.
</p>
</dd>

<br>
<p>
Below are some examples of legal input for S<small>YSTRE</small>. You
can cut and paste any of the following examples (or all of them) in a
<tt>.cgd</tt> file using your favorite text editor (e.g. Notepad on
Windows) and open it from within S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<p>
The S<small>YSTRE</small> format allows comments,
which start with a <tt>#</tt> character and continue until the end of
the current line.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1</b>: Diamond, specified by space group, unit cell and
positions. S<small>YSTRE</small> computes edges by finding nearest
neighbors. Edge lengths have to be larger than 0.1. If any pair of
nodes is closer than that, an error is reported. If this is the case
for your data, you should try scaling the unit cell parameters
accordingly. The keywords <tt>NODE</tt> and <tt>ATOM</tt> are
equivalent, as are the keywords <tt>ID</tt> and <tt>NAME</tt>.</p>
            
<pre>
# The type of data to expect

  # Structure id (optional; ID and NAME both work)

  # Cell parameters: a b c alpha beta gamma

  # Atom specification: name coordination x y z
  #   (decimal numbers or fractions can be used for coordinates)
  ATOM  1  4   5/8 5/8 5/8
# This ends the structure description
END
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2</b>: Diamond, specified as a periodic graph. Here,
only translational symmetries are assumed, and no coordinates are
needed. Edges are given explicitly in the form <em>u v x y z</em>,
where <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are node numbers and <em>x y z</em>
specifies the "address" of the unit cell to connect to as an integer
vector. For example, the line <tt>1 1  0 1 0</tt> defines an edge
between node 1 and its copy shifted one unit along the y axis.
</p>

longer to complete. It shows two situations in which quotes are
required.

<h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p>
If you encounter any problems, please check your input thoroughly.
There are many opportunities for typos and S<small>YSTRE</small> is
very sensitive to input errors, especially when edges are not given
explicitly.
</p>

<p>
There are some quirks and limitations, though, that you should be
aware of when using S<small>YSTRE</small>.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Nets that don't work (yet)</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
S<small>YSTRE</small> identifies nodes by their barycentric positions,
which is the key to its efficient algorithms. If different nodes
<em>collide</em>, i.e., if they have identical barycentric positions,
this method fails. The present version of S<small>YSTRE</small> is not
able to handle some nets with collisions and will produce an error
message.  This seems to be a fairly rare case, though, especially in
nets that emerge from actual crystal structures.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, S<small>YSTRE</small> currently only works for nets of
dimensions 2 (plane nets) and 3.
</p>

</dd>

<dt><b>Java problems</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
With some versions of the Java runtime environment, occasional program
crashes or miscalculations have been experienced.  S<small>YSTRE</small>
double-checks its computations very thoroughly, though, so that erroneous
results are highly unlikely
to go undetected.  Much more likely, the program will terminate for no
apparent reason or produce an "<tt>INTERNAL ERROR</tt>" message. In
those cases, the best strategy is to restart S<small>YSTRE</small> or
just to rerun the net that produced the problem.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Reporting bugs</b></dt>

<dd>
<p>
For the moment, please report bugs to <tt>odf@gavrog.org</tt>.
Make sure that your input is correct and that the problem is
reproducible.  Enclose your input file and any output that
S<small>YSTRE</small> produced, or, if that is not possible, describe
the problem and any messages that you may have seen as detailed as
possible. Tell me which operating system and which version of Java you
were using.
